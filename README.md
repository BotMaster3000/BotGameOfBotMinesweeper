# BotGameOfBotMinesweeper
A Test to create a Minesweeper-Console-Program following the SRP

This is a personal test to get used to the SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).
It might never be perfect, but I will try to make it as good as possible.

Please keep in mind that this project might never gets finished and might be abandoned, but lets hope for the best :)
